## 📖 AGPL v3 License Explained

### What is AGPL v3?

AGPL (Affero GPL) is like GPL but **stronger** - it includes **network copyleft**.

### Key Requirements:

#### ✅ You CAN:
- Use it for free
- Modify the code
- Use it commercially
- Distribute copies

#### ⚠️ You MUST:
- **Release your source code** if you distribute it
- **Release your source code** if you run it as a service (SaaS)
- **License your modifications under AGPL v3**
- Keep copyright notices
- Include the license text
- Document changes

#### ❌ You CANNOT:
- Use it in closed-source software
- Run a SaaS without releasing code
- Sublicense under different terms
- Remove copyright notices

### The "Network Copyleft" Rule

**This is the key difference from regular GPL:**

If you modify this software and let people use it **over a network** (like a web service, SaaS, hosted tool), you **MUST** provide them with the modified source code.

**Example Scenarios:**

❌ **VIOLATION:**
```
You modify the script
↓
Run it as a web service for clients
↓
Don't provide source code
↓
AGPL VIOLATION - must release code
```

✅ **COMPLIANT:**
```
You modify the script
↓
Run it as a web service for clients
↓
Provide source code to users
↓
AGPL COMPLIANT
```

✅ **ALTERNATIVE:**
```
You want proprietary SaaS
↓
Buy Commercial License
↓
No source code release required
↓
FULLY COMPLIANT
```
