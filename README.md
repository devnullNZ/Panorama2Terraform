# Palo Alto Panorama to Terraform Converter

A comprehensive Python utility to convert Palo Alto Panorama XML configuration exports into Terraform configuration files, **specifically designed to facilitate firewall migrations between different Palo Alto platforms**.

## 🎯 Purpose

This tool is purpose-built for **migrating Palo Alto firewalls to different platforms** (e.g., PA-3000 → PA-5000, physical → VM-Series). It extracts your complete configuration and generates both:
1. **Terraform files** for automated deployment
2. **Interface migration report** for planning interface mapping

## 📦 What's Included

- `panorama_to_terraform.py` - Main conversion script (comprehensive parser and generator)
- `sample_panorama_config.xml` - Example configuration with all features
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - **Complete step-by-step migration workflow**
- `USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive technical documentation
- `README.md` - This file
- `quick_start.sh` - Quick start demonstration script
- `example_interface_report.txt` - Sample interface inventory report

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Make scripts executable
chmod +x panorama_to_terraform.py quick_start.sh

# 2. Run the quick start demo
./quick_start.sh

# 3. Or convert your own Panorama config
python3 panorama_to_terraform.py your_config.xml --output-dir terraform_output
```

### v4.0.2 (December 2025) - Multi-VR & Split Script Fixes ⭐
**🐛 Fixed: Multiple Critical Issues**

**1. Virtual Router Multi-VR Support:**
- **Critical Fix:** Virtual routers missing when names duplicated across templates
- Added template-aware parsing with interface signature deduplication
- Now captures ALL VRs including multi-VR templates and duplicate names
- **Impact:** Configs with multiple templates now get all VRs (e.g., found 7 instead of 6)
- See [MULTI-VR-FIX.md](MULTI-VR-FIX.md) for technical details

**2. Split Device Groups Script:**
- **Critical Fix:** split_device_groups.py missing 99% of objects in split files
- Fixed: Only copied first `<shared>` section (Panorama has 11+ sections)
- Fixed: Duplicate device group detection
- Now merges ALL shared sections into split files
- **Impact:** Split files now include all 3,699 addresses, 430 services, etc. (was 0)
- See [SPLIT-SCRIPT-FIX.md](SPLIT-SCRIPT-FIX.md) for technical details

- Changed parse order to prioritize device-group definitions over shared references  
- Fixed 4 parsing methods: address objects, address groups, service objects, service groups
- **Impact:** All objects now have correct values populated
- See [SHARED-OBJECT-REFERENCE-FIX.md](SHARED-OBJECT-REFERENCE-FIX.md) for technical details
